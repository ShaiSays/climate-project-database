Create and populate three tables. This should be only part of your normalized design.

Choose three tables that are connected by PK-FK relationships.

Decide on data types for the attributes in these tables.

Make the tables using CREATE TABLE statements. Populate the tables with data from the sample documents using INSERT INTO statements.

Support
I am here to help you! You have seen but not used CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO statements. If you need help with these or any other part of the exercise, please let me know.

Other tables
I will write the code to create and populate the other tables, following your design as closely as I can.

If you need help
Commit and sync what you have, and then send a Canvas mail with a note about what help you’d like and whether you prefer mail or Zoom support.

Repository and Submitting
You will continue to use the https://github.com/kit-transue/climate-project-(your-username) that I invited you to as a collaborator.

To submit:

stage and commit any files you have added or modified
sync to GitHub
notify me in Canvas that you are done
When you sync, you should be able to see all your work in the GitHub repository page. (The page you launch Codespaces from.)

Automation
The supplied “reset.sh” will drop your database and recreate a new one from the SQL files in your repository. To run it, open the Terminal window and run “bash reset.sh” or “./reset.sh”.

After resetting the database the script calls “psql” to send “create.sql” to the server. There is nothing special about “create.sql”: it is usually easier to work with multiple smaller files. If you make multiple files or use a different name, just send them separately to the database server by adding more “psql -f ” lines in the script. (You can see this in the join-shelter “setup.sh” script.)

I will use reset.sh to run your code. At the end of this module, “./reset.sh” should run without any errors and should populate the three tables you have chosen.
